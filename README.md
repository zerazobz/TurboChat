A tiny angular app

At this moment I'm implemented the following items from the [main Angular Tutorial](https://angular.io/tutorial)

1. The hero editor
2. Displaying a list
3. Master/Detail Components
4. Services
	Components shouldn't fetch or save data directly and they shouldn't knowingly present fake data. They should focus on presenting data and delegate data access to a service.
